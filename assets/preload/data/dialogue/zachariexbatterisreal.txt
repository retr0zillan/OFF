-zacharie-Well, well, well! Look who's back! It's an absolute pleasure to see you again, Batter.
-batter-Likewise, Zacharie. I remember you.
-zacharie-Oh, I knew you wouldn't forget me. How could anyone forget a charming fellow like myself, right?
-batter-Indeed.
-zacharie-You know, it's quite curious that you still hold memories of your predecessor. 
-zacharie-Most people tend to forget such things after they've taken over, but not you, it seems.
-batter-Yes.
-zacharie-Anyway, I've got some bad news. 
-zacharie-It seems that, due to an incredibly convoluted and, dare I say, ridiculous series of events, I've misplaced my bag of wares.
-batter-Misplaced?
-zacharie-Oh, yes! It all started when I was crossing paths with an interdimensional chicken that was clucking a strange melody. 
-zacharie-Naturally, I had to dance along, and in the midst of my majestic chicken dance, a temporal vortex opened up and swallowed my bag whole!
-batter-A temporal vortex?
-zacharie-Exactly! It was like a whirlwind of colors and flavors! I could taste the rainbow, I tell you. 
-zacharie-Alas, my bag of wonders vanished into the spacetime continuum.
-batter-I see.
-zacharie-Now, here comes the part where I ask for a favor. 
-zacharie-If, by any chance, you happen to stumble upon my bag of wares during your journey, could you be so kind as to bring it back to me?
-batter-I will keep an eye out.
-zacharie-Wonderful! To show my appreciation for your help, take these two Fortune tickets. 
-zacharie-They'll come in handy, especially when you're in a tight spot.
-narrator-You have received 2 Fortune Tickets.
-batter-Thanks.
-zacharie-Consider it a small payment for the potential inconvenience. 
-zacharie-And don't worry; I'll be right here, waiting patiently for you to return with good news. 
-zacharie-Now, go forth and conquer, my cold and serene friend.
