-zacharie-Oh, you've actually done it! You found my bag! Bravo, Batter, bravo!
-batter-Yes, here it is.
-zacharie-Ah, everything seems to be in order. You have my deepest gratitude, my serene friend.
-batter-You're welcome.
-zacharie-As a token of my appreciation, I have something for you. Here, take this.
-narrator-You have received A Switch.
-batter-A switch?
-zacharie-Oh, it may seem like a simple item, but I have a hunch that it suits your personality quite well. 
-zacharie-You see, just like you, this switch has an air of detachment and calmness about it. 
-zacharie-But, of course, that's just my quirky intuition talking.
-batter-What does it do?
-zacharie-Ah, that's a secret I'll leave for you to uncover. 
-zacharie-Think of it as a little mystery gift, fitting for a mysterious character like yourself. 
-zacharie-It might come in handy during your journey, or it might just sit quietly in your inventory. 
-zacharie-Who knows? The thrill is in the discovery!
-batter-Alright, thanks.
