-zacharie-Look who's here! Batter, my friend! It's an absolute pleasure to see you again! 
-zacharie-Thank you, once more, for helping me find my stash of goodies the last time. You truly saved the day!
-batter-No need to thank me.
-zacharie-Ah, but now I have some unfortunate news again. 
-zacharie-You won't believe this, but I seem to have lost my inventory book! Can you imagine the absurdity of it? 
-zacharie-It just disappeared into thin air, poof!
-batter-Lost your inventory book?
-zacharie-Oh, it's a tale of woe and wonder, my friend. 
-zacharie-You see, last night, as I was strolling through the streets, a flock of mischievous, neon painted seagulls swooped down upon me.
-zacharie-And one of them had the audacity to snatch my book right from my hands!
-zacharie-They squawked in harmony as they flew away, leaving me in utter bewilderment!
-batter-Seriously?
-zacharie-Yes! And they were singing their own little sea shanty.
-zacharie-I tell you! Quite the sight to behold, but my precious book was gone in an instant.
-batter-I'll be sure to keep an eye out for your missing book.
-zacharie-Fantastic! You're a true lifesaver, Batter. 
-zacharie-If you do find it, please be kind enough to bring it back to me. 
-zacharie-I'll be waiting right here, hoping the seagulls will have mercy on me and return it someday.
