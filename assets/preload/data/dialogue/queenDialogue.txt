-queen-You are finally here, Batter...
-queen-Faster than i expected...
-queen-But your way was in vain. I will make sure you dont return a last time.
-narrator-Always keeping his icy assurance, the batter said...
-batter-Your guardians have fallen. You're now the Queen of a kingdom that no longer exists.
-queen-Why have you destroyed the nation that I have rebuilt?
-narrator-The answer was simple...
-batter-You've never been in this place to do even the slightest thing.
-batter-Your role was to take care of him and you failed.
-batter-Now i must complete my sacred mission.
-narrator-Continually withstanding the attacks that the Batter had brought into the monotonous dialogue between them.
-narrator-The Queen called a spade a spade...
-queen-I have done all of this for him.
-batter-We were so busy preparing the birthday party that we forgot who it was for.
-queen-You have ruined everything Batter.
-queen-I will get rid of you for his sake.
-queen-And then I will rebuild everything.
-queen-Prepare yourself Batter, you are not returning this time.
