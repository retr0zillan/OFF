-zacharie-Ah, hello there, Batter! It's good to see you again. 
-zacharie-I wanted to express my gratitude for all the help you've given me in acquiring those items for my shop. 
-zacharie-You've been quite a reliable customer.
-batter-You're welcome.
-zacharie-Well, I'm afraid I need your assistance once again. 
-zacharie-You see, I've lost one of my favorite masks in a different timeline. 
-zacharie-It's quite a tragedy, really. 
-zacharie-But I have an interesting proposition for you, considering I've noticed your fondness for battles. 
-zacharie-In exchange for finding my mask, I'd be willing to engage in a friendly combat with you. 
-zacharie-Though I must admit, I'm nowhere near as strong as you, being a mere salesman.
-batter-Altering time and space is not within my capabilities. It is not possible.
-zacharie-Ah, you're right, my dear Batter.
-zacharie-However, I believe your friend, might just be capable of such a feat. 
-zacharie-You see, playerPronoum has the ability to manipulate time. 
-zacharie-Perhaps playerPronoum could assist me in retrieving my mask.
-batter-My friend?, you mean userName?
-zacharie-Yes, precisely! You catch on quickly. 
-zacharie-If anyone can alter time, it would be them.
-zacharie- So, do you think you can persuade playerName to help me? I'll be eagerly waiting for your response.
-batter-I suppose it may be possible. I'll see what I can do. 
-batter-Don't get your hopes up, though.
-zacharie-Excellent! I knew I could count on you, Batter. 
-zacharie-You're always so reliable. Just remember, my mask got lost in a rather peculiar manner. 
-zacharie-You see, during one of my time-traveling adventures back in 2008, I accidentally left it behind. 
-zacharie-Quite the humorous situation, wouldn't you say?
-zacharie-But nonetheless, it's a mask I hold dear, and I hope it can be retrieved.
-batter-2008, got it.
