-dedan-What the fuck?! How the hell did you get in here?
-batter-One of the mine workers let me pass. It seems he wasn't aware of your instructions.
-dedan-That dumbass Elsen! I'll deal with him later. 
-dedan-But first, let me make one thing clear, you piece of shit. You're not welcome here!
-batter-I came here to destroy you, Dedan.
-dedan-Oh, do you not remember what happened to your pathetic predecessor? I'll spare you the details.
-batter-Your words don't affect me.
-dedan-You think you can just waltz in here and cause chaos without consequences? 
-dedan-Even if you manage to eliminate me, you know damn well what it means for Zone 1!
-batter-My mission to purify the world is more important than collateral damage.
-dedan-You're gonna fail, just like the last Batter. And when you do, I'll be the one laughing at your sorry ass.
-batter-...
-dedan-How the fuck did you manage to use the black box anyway? 
-dedan-It's designed exclusively for the guardians of the zones, and only they have the power to wield it.
-batter-...
-dedan-Answer me, you goddamn bastard!
-batter-...
-dedan-Have you finished your silence act, you son of a bitch? I'm going to annihilate you!
-batter-Bring it on.
