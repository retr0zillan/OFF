-dedan-Listen up! I got a warning for ya, and you better listen real good. 
-dedan-If you ever see that damn Batter around here, you better not let him pass into the smoke mines. You understand me?
-elsenMiner-Uh... y...yes, Dedan... I... I wont... let him... through...
-dedan-Damn right you won't!
-dedan- Cause if that Batter gets his hands on the black box inside those mines, he'll be able to travel directly to the other guardian zones.
-dedan-And we can't let that happen! So you better make damn sure he doesn't even get close!
-elsenMiner-B...b...but, Dedan... I... I'm... really scared... Those... aggressive ghosts you left to guard the black box...
-elsenMiner- They're... hurting and scaring the workers... 
-elsenMiner-I don't know if... I can handle it...
-dedan-Scared, huh? You think I give a damn about your fear?! Those ghosts are there to keep everyone in line!
-dedan- They'll tear apart anyone who tries to mess with that black box.
-dedan-And if you can't handle it, maybe you're just useless trash like the rest of em.
-elsenMiner-N...no, I... I'll do my... best, Dedan... I won't let... anyone... near... the black box... I promise...
-dedan-You better keep that promise, you stuttering fool. If I find out you let that Batter slip through, I'll make sure you regret it. Don't think I won't!
-elsenMiner-I... understand, Dedan... I'll... do everything... I can... to protect... the... black box...
-dedan-Good. Now get your sorry ass outta here and get to work. And remember, Im watching you. Dont screw this up.
-elsenMiner-Yes... Dedan...
